## 📝 Overview

**Notify** is an event-based connector designed to automate real-time message delivery through multiple communication channels such as **WhatsApp**, **Email**, and **SMS**. It listens to specific events triggered in commercetools—like order creations or status updates—and sends notifications based on the subscriptions defined within the platform.

Notify empowers businesses to:

- 🔔 **Enhance customer engagement** with timely and relevant updates.
- 🛠️ **Configure channel-specific message templates** for each subscription.
- 📊 **Track delivery status** of every message across all channels.
- 🧩 **Easily manage subscriptions**—create, edit, or remove subscriptions directly via the Notify UI

## 🏗️ Architecture
![Basic Architecture](basic_architecture.jpg)

### Message Flow Explained

- **Subscription Creation**  
  Users create subscriptions via the Notify Front-End (Merchant Center). For example, adding an OrderStateChanged subscription through the UI creates a corresponding subscription in commercetools.

- **Event Triggered**  
  When a relevant event (like a change in order state) occurs, commercetools publishes a message to the configured Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic.

- **Message Received by Notify**  
  The Notify Connector subscribes to the Pub/Sub topic and receives the message.

- **Message Processing**  
  Upon receiving the message, the connector:
  - Parses the event payload
  - Retrieves the user-defined configurations (e.g., selected channels, message templates, recipients)
  - Determines which channels the message should be sent to

- **Message Dispatch**  
  The connector delivers the message across all configured channels:
  - 📩 **Email**
  - 📱 **SMS**
  - 💬 **WhatsApp**
  - 🔄 **Other supported or custom channels**
